# House-Price-Prediction-Project

#### In this project we are going to use supervised learning, which is a branch of machine learning where we teach our model by examples. Here we will first explore different attributes of Boston housing dataset then a part of dataset will be used to train the linear regression algorithm after that we will use the trained model to give predictions on remaining part of dataset
